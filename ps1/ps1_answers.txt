Problem A.5: Writeup

1. Based on compare_cow_transport_alogrithms, my greedy algortihm used 6 trips 
([['Betsy'], ['Henrietta'], ['Herman', 'Maggie'], ['Oreo', 'Moo Moo'], 
['Millie', 'Milkshake', 'Lola'], ['Florence']])

and the brute force algorithm used only 5 trips
([['Henrietta'], ['Lola', 'Millie', 'Moo Moo'], ['Betsy'], ['Herman', 'Maggie'], 
['Milkshake', 'Florence', 'Oreo']]). 

The greedy algorithm runs much quicker, because it runs on the order of O(nlogn). 
The brute force method runs exponentially, therefore taking mmuch longer to complete.

2. It depends on how you define optimal. If computational efficiency is what
you  want to maximize, then the greedy algorithm is optimal because it runs much
quicker than the brute force method. But, if you want to find a globally optimal
solution to the issue of transporting cows, then this is not the optimal method.

3. Similarly, it depends on how you define optimal. This method is computationally
far less efficient than the greedy algorithm, but it does produce the globally optimal
solution to transporting the cows in the fewest number of trips.
